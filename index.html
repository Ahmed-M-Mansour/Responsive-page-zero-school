                The basic rule of thumb with paragraphing
                is to keep one idea to one paragraph.
                If you begin to transition into a new
                idea, it belongs in a new paragraph.
                There are some simple ways to tell if
                you are on the same topic or a new one.
                You can have one idea and several bits
                of supporting evidence within a single
                paragraph. You can also have several points
                in a single paragraph as long as they relate
                to the overall topic of the paragraph. If the
                single points start to get long, then perhaps elaborating
                on each of them and placing them in their own paragraphs is the
                route to go.
